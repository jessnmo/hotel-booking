# hotel-booking

I am testing my ability to find a design and duplicate it completely. This time using booking.com as an example

In the header search area where you can pick dates and choose the number of people and rooms I didn't use html input tags, instead for date picker, I found a npm package for date picker called react-date-range. You could [npm install react-date-range], and find many options in this demo: https://hypeserver.github.io/react-date-range/. This saved a lot of time in CSS!
