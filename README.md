# hotel-booking [WIP]

I am testing my ability to find a design and duplicate it completely. This time using booking.com as an example
Currently working on the frontend design, will move on to work on the backend when satisfied with frontend : ) 

## Interesting Learning


In the header search area where you can pick dates and choose the number of people and rooms I didn't use html input tags, instead for date picker, I found a npm package for date picker called react-date-range. You could [npm install react-date-range], and find many options in this demo: https://hypeserver.github.io/react-date-range/. This saved a lot of time in CSS!

## Navigation 

/ -> landing page 
/search -> will only display when input for either destination/ date/ how many people is valid
/search/:id -> id being the destination, will show you the detail of a hotel

## Live


Still building the site, but checking in on the progress here: https://booking-travel-jessnmo.netlify.app/
